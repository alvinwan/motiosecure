# MotioSecure
Simple security platform with motion detection implementation for cheap, low-quality camera lens

**Mac and iOS apps are coming soon**

Ever have a friend hijack your computer while you're away? Ever wanted to catch them red-handed? Run this application to do just that. With just an iOS app and a mac app, you'll be good to go. **Applications are pending review. Want it now? See Development installation instructions below.**

- Sends a notification to your phone when motion is detected
- Saves all detected motion as mp4 videos for playback
- Surprise the intruder with a live camera feed, and engage with your invader in conversation!
- Uses Apple security protocols to make live feed, notifications available; no janky, inter-device, unencrypted communication

> This is not a serious security platform. For all intents and purposes, I wrote it to prank my friends. With that said, the application actually does what I claim above. I make no guarantees about its ability to prevent theft or its security. Please don't use this seriously.
